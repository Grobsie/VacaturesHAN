# VacaturesHAN
As of writing, the HAN does not provide a mailing list in which new job listings are sent around.

this simple program will retrieve the current job listings using a Selenium web driver and put them in a file. It will check if new job listings are present compared to the previous time the program ran.
if new jobs are available, an email will be sent using the javax.mailer.

I run the script using a crontab schedule
